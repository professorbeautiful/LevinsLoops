NOTES on deploying LoopModelExplorer
Once it's deployed and running,
  shinyapps::showLogs(appPath = "inst/LoopModelExplorer/", appFile = "app.R")
to see what's going on.

Just .deploy() doesnt work.
  Error in library("LoopAnalyst") :
    there is no package called ‘LoopAnalyst’
Installs withr, whisker, xtable, mime, packrat before building LevinsLoops.
Also generates a bunch of copies (12) of this:
Found more than one class "pipe" in cache; using the first, from namespace 'BiocGenerics'

This works (with some problems still):
  .installFromGithub('LevinsLoops')
  deployApp("inst/LoopModelExplorer/", "app.R")
The app runs. The dynamic graph shows. No pictures though.
  Error: could not find function "%>%".
I removed it from shinyDebuggingPanel, and reloaded from github via
  .installFromGithub('shinyDebuggingPanel')

Another problem is the pictures from LoopAnalyst. Bad idea to use "dot"!
Here is the search list:
[1] ".GlobalEnv" "package:shinyDebuggingPanel"
[3] "package:shinyBS" "package:LoopAnalyst"
[5] "package:nlme" "package:LevinsLoops"
[7] "package:shiny" "package:stats"
[9] "package:graphics" "package:grDevices"
[11] "package:utils" "package:datasets"
[13] "package:methods" "Autoloads"
[15] "package:base"
We can see the dot files, pasting this into the R eval box:
  system("cat M.graphcm.dot", intern=T)
[1] "digraph G {"
[2] "graph [bgcolor = \"transparent\", size = \"18!,18!\", nodesep=\"1\", ranksep=\"1\", rankdir=\"LR\"];"
[3] "node [fixedsize=true, fontname=\"Sans\", fontsize=\"76.85\", shape=circle, height=\"2\", width=\"2\", style=\"setlinewidth(4)\"];"
ETCETERA

There is no dot and no graphviz at shinyapps.io
  system("which graphviz", intern=T)
Here is the path: "/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"

There is however a graphviz tree at /usr/lib/graphviz
      system("ls /usr/lib/graphviz", intern=T)
  system("find /usr/lib/graphviz -name dot", intern=T)
system("locate dot | grep '/dot$' ", intern=T)  === nothing at remote; finds program locally.

On my computer it is at /usr/local/lib/graphviz. Looks the same.

In stackoverflow, [dot] AND [graphviz] AND [shinyapps] returns no hits.
[dot] AND [shinyapps]
I tried python gv.py
Fatal Python error: Interpreter not initialized (version mismatch?)

I tried
  gtemp = Rgraphviz::agread(filename = "inst/LoopModelExplorer/M.graphcem.dot")
Rgraphviz::plot(gtemp)
and it 'works' but so messed up that it's useless.

Today I posted an "issue" at
https://github.com/rstudio/shinyapps-package-dependencies

Apparently Rgraphviz just can't do it right. Here's a complaint from Alexis Dinno <alexis.dinno at pdx.edu> , Mr. LoopAnalyst himself.
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/bioconductor/2012-December/049899.html
and subsequent correspondence indicates that Rgraphviz will be of no use.
