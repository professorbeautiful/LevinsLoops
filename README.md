# LevinsLoops
This package provides a "shiny" app to facilitate playing with Richard Levins's loop models, based on the idea of moving equilibria. One can edit models, and visualize the dynamical system as it converges and responds to interventions. See the document "Using_the\_package\_LevinsLoops.pdf" for details.
